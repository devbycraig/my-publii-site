Or wish you had a crystal ball to understand what helps them thrive in a group setting? Preschool teachers don’t have crystal balls—but they do have a front-row seat to some of the most revealing (and reassuring!) parts of your child’s development.</p><p>And while every child is different, there are a few universal things preschool teachers wish they could gently whisper to every parent. These are the everyday insights that make preschool life smoother—and home life, too.</p><hr><h3>What You’ll Learn in This Post</h3><ul><li>What behaviors are totally normal (even when they seem worrying)</li><li>How to support your child’s independence</li><li>Why routines and limits matter more than you think</li><li>How to build stronger preschool-home connection</li></ul><h3>1. Big Feelings Are Normal (and Expected)</h3><p>Preschoolers are still learning how to manage frustration, disappointment, and change. So yes, your calm, sweet child might throw their backpack across the room at drop-off—or cry when they don’t get the red marker.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Outbursts, tears, and meltdowns are developmentally normal. Preschool is often the first place children are expected to share space, time, and materials all day. It’s a big adjustment.</p><p><strong>What helps at home:</strong></p><ul><li>Talk about emotions using simple words (“You’re feeling mad because it’s hard to wait.”)</li><li>Let your child practice calming tools (breathing, squeezing a pillow, having a quiet space)</li><li>Don’t expect perfection—expect progress</li></ul><h3>2. Your Child is More Independent Than You Think</h3><p>At preschool, your child probably pours their own water, puts on their shoes, helps tidy up, and solves problems with peers—with a bit of coaching.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Children rise to expectations when given space and time. It’s often at home where we do more for them than they truly need.</p><p><strong>Try this at home:</strong></p><ul><li>Let your child do small jobs (packing snacks, wiping spills, putting away toys)</li><li>Give them choices when possible (“Do you want to put on your socks or shirt first?”)</li><li>Resist jumping in too soon—mistakes are part of learning</li></ul><h3>3. Consistency is a Gift</h3><p>Children thrive on predictable routines, clear expectations, and gentle but firm boundaries. It helps them feel safe—and makes transitions smoother.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Saying “no” or holding a boundary isn’t mean. It’s loving. Preschoolers test limits because they need to know where the edges are.</p><p><strong>What helps at home:</strong></p><ul><li>Use routines for transitions (like a bedtime or morning checklist)</li><li>Follow through calmly when limits are tested</li><li>Keep your language short and clear (“It’s time to clean up now.”)</li></ul><h3>4. They Don’t Need to Know Everything—Yet</h3><p>It’s tempting to worry if your child doesn’t recognize all the letters or write their name “just right.” But preschool isn’t a race to kindergarten.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Social and emotional skills—like playing cooperatively, waiting their turn, or handling frustration—matter just as much (and often more) than early academics at this age.</p><p><strong>Support learning by:</strong></p><ul><li>Reading together daily and talking about the story</li><li>Encouraging curiosity (“Why do you think that happened?”)</li><li>Focusing on effort, not outcomes (“You really kept trying!”)</li></ul><h3>5. Your Words Matter—More Than You Think</h3><p>How you talk about your child and their experiences shapes how they see themselves. Teachers often hear echoes of home in the way children describe themselves: “I’m not good at drawing” or “I always spill.”</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Your words have power. Celebrate effort, kindness, and resilience more than performance or perfection.</p><p><strong>Try saying:</strong></p><ul><li>“You worked hard on that.”</li><li>“I love how you helped your friend.”</li><li>“It’s okay to make mistakes—we all do!”</li></ul><h3>6. Drop-Off Wobbles Are Okay</h3><p>That clingy goodbye? It doesn’t mean something’s wrong. In fact, many children cry during goodbyes—and bounce happily into play five minutes later.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Consistent, confident drop-offs build trust. Avoid sneaking away, and try to keep goodbyes brief but loving.</p><p><strong>What helps:</strong></p><ul><li>Have a short goodbye routine (hug + phrase like “See you after snack!”)</li><li>Trust the teachers—they’ve helped many children through this stage</li><li>Ask the teacher for updates if it reassures you</li></ul><h3>7. We’re on the Same Team</h3><p>Teachers care deeply about your child. When home and preschool work together, children benefit in big ways.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Share what’s going on at home (new baby, bad sleep, changes). Let us know how we can support you.</p><p><strong>To build a great partnership:</strong></p><ul><li>Ask how your child’s day was (and not just about academics!)</li><li>Share concerns early—before they grow</li><li>Celebrate wins together—those little moments mean a lot!</li></ul><hr><h3>Summary: What Preschool Teachers Wish Parents Knew</h3><ul><li>Big feelings are part of the preschool journey</li><li>Children are more capable than we think—let them try!</li><li>Routines and limits create safety, not restriction</li><li>Emotional skills matter just as much as ABCs</li><li>Your words shape their self-image—speak kindly</li><li>Separation takes practice—be calm and consistent</li><li>Home and preschool are partners, not separate worlds</li></ul><h3>You’re Doing Better Than You Think</h3><p>Preschool years are full of growth—for children and parents. There’s no such thing as doing it perfectly. But with a little insight from the classroom, you can support your child with confidence, compassion, and a whole lot more connection.</p><p>And remember: you don’t need to have all the answers. Just being curious, open, and loving goes a long, long way.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/tags/blog/">Blog</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://mariavernon.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmariavernon.com%2Fwhat-preschool-teachers-wish-parents-knew.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mariavernon.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmariavernon.com%2Fwhat-preschool-teachers-wish-parents-knew.html&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmariavernon.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F33%2FPreschool-Teachers-Advice.jpg&amp;description=What%20Preschool%20Teachers%20Wish%20Parents%20Knew" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://mariavernon.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://mariavernon.com/authors/maria-vernon/" rel="author">Maria Vernon</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>With 30 years experience as an early childhood teacher, plus a few more as a mother and grandmother, I offer gentle parenting advice aimed at supporting parents in nurturing their children's growth and finding joy in the everyday moments of family life.</p></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://mariavernon.com/test-post.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://mariavernon.com/media/posts/37/responsive/Fun-Facts-About-Preschoolers-xs.jpg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="1076" width="1076"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Fun Facts About Preschoolers</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item"><figure class="feed__image related__image"><img src="https://mariavernon.com/media/posts/37/Fun-Facts-About-Preschoolers.jpg" srcset="https://mariavernon.com/media/posts/37/responsive/Fun-Facts-About-Preschoolers-xs.jpg 640w, https://mariavernon.com/media/posts/37/responsive/Fun-Facts-About-Preschoolers-sm.jpg 768w, https://mariavernon.com/media/posts/37/responsive/Fun-Facts-About-Preschoolers-md.jpg 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) calc(4.38vw + 143px), 87.86vw" loading="lazy" height="1076" width="1920" alt=""></figure><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://mariavernon.com/authors/maria-vernon/" class="feed__author">Maria Vernon</a></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://mariavernon.com/test-post.html">Fun Facts About Preschoolers</a></h3></header><p>Brain &amp; Development Facts "A preschooler's brain makes about 1 million new neural connections every second!
