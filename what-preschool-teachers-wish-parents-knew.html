Or wish you had a crystal ball to understand what helps them thrive in a group setting? Preschool teachers don’t have crystal balls—but they do have a front-row seat to some of the most revealing (and reassuring!) parts of your child’s development.</p><p>And while every child is different, there are a few universal things preschool teachers wish they could gently whisper to every parent. These are the everyday insights that make preschool life smoother—and home life, too.</p><hr><h3>What You’ll Learn in This Post</h3><ul><li>What behaviors are totally normal (even when they seem worrying)</li><li>How to support your child’s independence</li><li>Why routines and limits matter more than you think</li><li>How to build stronger preschool-home connection</li></ul><h3>1. Big Feelings Are Normal (and Expected)</h3><p>Preschoolers are still learning how to manage frustration, disappointment, and change. So yes, your calm, sweet child might throw their backpack across the room at drop-off—or cry when they don’t get the red marker.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Outbursts, tears, and meltdowns are developmentally normal. Preschool is often the first place children are expected to share space, time, and materials all day. It’s a big adjustment.</p><p><strong>What helps at home:</strong></p><ul><li>Talk about emotions using simple words (“You’re feeling mad because it’s hard to wait.”)</li><li>Let your child practice calming tools (breathing, squeezing a pillow, having a quiet space)</li><li>Don’t expect perfection—expect progress</li></ul><h3>2. Your Child is More Independent Than You Think</h3><p>At preschool, your child probably pours their own water, puts on their shoes, helps tidy up, and solves problems with peers—with a bit of coaching.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Children rise to expectations when given space and time. It’s often at home where we do more for them than they truly need.</p><p><strong>Try this at home:</strong></p><ul><li>Let your child do small jobs (packing snacks, wiping spills, putting away toys)</li><li>Give them choices when possible (“Do you want to put on your socks or shirt first?”)</li><li>Resist jumping in too soon—mistakes are part of learning</li></ul><h3>3. Consistency is a Gift</h3><p>Children thrive on predictable routines, clear expectations, and gentle but firm boundaries. It helps them feel safe—and makes transitions smoother.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Saying “no” or holding a boundary isn’t mean. It’s loving. Preschoolers test limits because they need to know where the edges are.</p><p><strong>What helps at home:</strong></p><ul><li>Use routines for transitions (like a bedtime or morning checklist)</li><li>Follow through calmly when limits are tested</li><li>Keep your language short and clear (“It’s time to clean up now.”)</li></ul><h3>4. They Don’t Need to Know Everything—Yet</h3><p>It’s tempting to worry if your child doesn’t recognize all the letters or write their name “just right.” But preschool isn’t a race to kindergarten.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Social and emotional skills—like playing cooperatively, waiting their turn, or handling frustration—matter just as much (and often more) than early academics at this age.</p><p><strong>Support learning by:</strong></p><ul><li>Reading together daily and talking about the story</li><li>Encouraging curiosity (“Why do you think that happened?”)</li><li>Focusing on effort, not outcomes (“You really kept trying!”)</li></ul><h3>5. Your Words Matter—More Than You Think</h3><p>How you talk about your child and their experiences shapes how they see themselves. Teachers often hear echoes of home in the way children describe themselves: “I’m not good at drawing” or “I always spill.”</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Your words have power. Celebrate effort, kindness, and resilience more than performance or perfection.</p><p><strong>Try saying:</strong></p><ul><li>“You worked hard on that.”</li><li>“I love how you helped your friend.”</li><li>“It’s okay to make mistakes—we all do!”</li></ul><h3>6. Drop-Off Wobbles Are Okay</h3><p>That clingy goodbye? It doesn’t mean something’s wrong. In fact, many children cry during goodbyes—and bounce happily into play five minutes later.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Consistent, confident drop-offs build trust. Avoid sneaking away, and try to keep goodbyes brief but loving.</p><p><strong>What helps:</strong></p><ul><li>Have a short goodbye routine (hug + phrase like “See you after snack!”)</li><li>Trust the teachers—they’ve helped many children through this stage</li><li>Ask the teacher for updates if it reassures you</li></ul><h3>7. We’re on the Same Team</h3><p>Teachers care deeply about your child. When home and preschool work together, children benefit in big ways.</p><p><strong>What teachers want you to know:</strong> Share what’s going on at home (new baby, bad sleep, changes). Let us know how we can support you.</p><p><strong>To build a great partnership:</strong></p><ul><li>Ask how your child’s day was (and not just about academics!)</li><li>Share concerns early—before they grow</li><li>Celebrate wins together—those little moments mean a lot!</li></ul><hr><h3>Summary: What Preschool Teachers Wish Parents Knew</h3><ul><li>Big feelings are part of the preschool journey</li><li>Children are more capable than we think—let them try!</li><li>Routines and limits create safety, not restriction</li><li>Emotional skills matter just as much as ABCs</li><li>Your words shape their self-image—speak kindly</li><li>Separation takes practice—be calm and consistent</li><li>Home and preschool are partners, not separate worlds</li></ul><h3>You’re Doing Better Than You Think</h3><p>Preschool years are full of growth—for children and parents. There’s no such thing as doing it perfectly. But with a little insight from the classroom, you can support your child with confidence, compassion, and a whole lot more connection.</p><p>And remember: you don’t need to have all the answers. Just being curious, open, and loving goes a long, long way.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on November 14, 2025</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/tags/blog/">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://mariavernon.com/authors/maria-vernon/" class="invert" rel="author">Maria Vernon</a></h3><p>With 30 years experience as an early childhood teacher, plus a few more as a mother and grandmother, I offer gentle parenting advice aimed at supporting parents in nurturing their children's growth and finding joy in the everyday moments of family life.</p></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/" target="_self">Home</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><span aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">My Books</span><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/thereisalwaysareason.html" target="_self">There Is Always a Reason</a></li><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/superpowers.html" target="_self">Parenting Superpowers</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><a href="https://mariavernon.com/superpower-field-guide.html" target="_self" aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Book-Related Downloads</a><ul class="submenu level-3" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/there-is-always-a-reason-checklist.html" target="_self">There Is Always a Reason Checklist</a></li><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/superpower-field-guide.html" target="_self">Parenting Superpowers Field Guide</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/community.html" target="_self">Community</a></li><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/tags/blog/" target="_self">Articles</a></li><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/contact.html" target="_self">Contact</a></li><li><a href="https://mariavernon.com/privacy.html" target="_self">Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="align-center">Copyright © 2025 Maria Vernon. All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://mariavernon.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://mariavernon.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://mariavernon.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://mariavernon.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://mariavernon.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
